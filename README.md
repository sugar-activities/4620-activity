About Cuadraditos Activity
==========================

This is QR scanner for the OLPC's XO Sugar environment.

Cuadraditos activity was inspired by the Record Activity source code
(version 79).


Usage
=====

This activity was developed with ease of use in mind. 

Just fire the app and point the XO camera to QR target and Cuadraditos will
automatically decode it. Right now it only detects two kind of data, URLs
and text.

There is still no official way of running an activity from another activity,
so the interaction between the browser and Cuadraditos is done through the
clipboard.
Text is displayed in the activity and gives the user the chance to copy
it to the clipboard. URLs are automatically copied to the clipboard.
